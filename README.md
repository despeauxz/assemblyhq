This is an application that helps you search Github API by query and conditions(Users or Organizations). THe application provides the following features.

Feature List:
* A form for searching, with a text input.
* Voice search capturing.
* A set of radio inputs for switching between searching for organizations or users.
* When the form is submitted, a view of that search term's results, each result listing displays some basic information about the result (e.g., name, avatar and links).
* End-to-end regression testing with Cypress

UI state that shows when the API request is in progress(Spinners), when there are no results found and error capturing with ErrorBoundary HOC.
